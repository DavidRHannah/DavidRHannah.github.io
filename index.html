            <h3>Console Based RPG</h3>
            <p>This is was my first collaborative project at UCR. 
                I was exposed to a ton of technologies and software development concepts from this month-long project! 
                My team followed the scrum agile project management framework by meeting throughout the week and executing
                sprints which aimed to knock-out an epic per sprint. Once we divied out the user stories for the epic we planned
                to takedown, we followed a Test Driven Development methodolgy by creating our unit tests at the beginning of each sprint. 
                This was done using the googletest testing framework. However, before any code was written, we developed our KanBan board, Screen Layout 
                Flow and Class Diagrams using LucidChart as well. We also used github and git for version control and never committed to main! (on purpose at least).
                We each made sure to check for memory leaks using Valgrind's memcheck program to ensure we maintained zero memory leaks! We also
                used gcov to achieve at least 80% code coverage as well.
                While I'd love to share the repository to everyone, I cannot due to potential plagiarism concerns. However, if you would like
                to learn more about this project, <a href="#contact">contact me for questions</a>! I'd love to discuss it.
