                <h3>Console Based RPG</h3>
                <p>This is was my first collaborative project at UCR. 
                    I was exposed to a ton of technologies and software development concepts from this month long project! 
                    My team followed the <b>scrum agile</b> project management framework by meeting throughout the week and executing
                    <b>sprints</b> which aimed to knock-out an <b>epic</b> per <b>sprint</b>. Once we divied out the <b>user stories</b> for the <b>epic</b> we planned
                    to finish, we followed a <b>Test Driven Development</b> methodolgy by creating <b>unit tests</b> at the beginning of each <b>sprint</b>. 
                    This was done using the <b>google testing framework</b>. However, before any code was written, we developed our <b>KanBan</b> board for planning, <b>Navigation</b> and <b>Screen Layout 
                    Flow and Class Diagrams</b> using LucidChart as well. We also used <b>github</b> and <b>git</b> for <b>version control</b> and never committed to main! (on purpose at least).
                    We each made sure to check for memory leaks using <b>Valgrind's memcheck</b> program to ensure we maintained zero memory leaks! We also
                    used <b>gcov</b> to achieve at least <b>80% code coverage</b> as well.
                    While I'd love to share the repository to everyone, however I cannot due to potential plagiarism concerns. However, if you would like
                    to learn more about this project, contact me for questions! I'd love to discuss it.
